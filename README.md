## Objective
Learn about fundamental latency compensation methods that provide clients with a smooth, real-time experience.

## TODO
- Should be cross-platform, so need to test on Linux eventually
- dumb client
- client-side prediction (without reconciliation)
- client-side prediction (with reconciliation)
- entity interpolation
- final program
  - uses all techniques
  - interactive UI to toggle each technique, client lag and server update rate

## Dependencies
- SDL2

## Tools
- C++20
- Windows (since WSL2 + Win10 don't have great support for GUI)
- make
- CMake
- VS Code

## Fun, later
- zig as \[cross\]compiler
- compare VS/MSVC to msys2/mingw
- try zig instead of C++
